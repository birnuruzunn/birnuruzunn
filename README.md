Hi, I'm Birnur! 
I am a **computer engineer** who loves to learn new things, is determined, hardworking and is very keen on technology. I am also a **master's student in Information systems engineering**. :mortar_board: :books: :smile:

Whenever I have the opportunity, I develop open-source projects and share them here. It is my greatest wish and happiness that my works can be a solution to people's problems.

I am currently working on computer networks security and system management.
